Emobot is an emotional AI that listens to users' emotions through live recording, captures their facial expressions, and recognizes the extent of emotion. It converts speech to text and provides necessary emotional support in the form of text.

## Technologies Used

- OpenCV: Used for image and video processing, including face detection.
- NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations, particularly in image manipulation.
- DeepFace: A deep learning-based facial analysis library used for emotion detection.
- Collections: Specifically, the Counter class is used for counting the occurrences of each detected emotion.
- Haar cascade classifier: Pre-trained cascade classifier for face detection included in OpenCV.
- Streamlit: Used for the frontend.
